        "description": "<p>Christine Brooke-Rose published with Carcanet Press of Manchester her extraordinary Xorandor, a computer novel, not just about computers but partly written in programming language.<\/p><p> Written entirely in dialogue and transcripts of conversations, the story often uses tag-names to encode its sentences or phrases in a manner imitative of electronic encoding. A twin brother and sister discover a sentient, radioactive, computer-stone from a silicon civilization, which they name Xorandor. They then save the day by neutralizing Xorandor's offspring [who], because of a programming defect defined as a syntax error, turns terrorist . . . and threatens to turn into a nuclear bomb. In a society where literature and philosophy are obsolete, the twins find the process of narrating difficult, but they learn to speak a slang based on electronic and computer words (e.g., diodic for super), and struggle with the difficulties of storytelling (dictating into a pocket computer) which seems harder than to make up the most complex program. The girl twin ponders: If the storytellers are characters THEN their confusion is part of their characters ENDIF. Inversely IF the characters are the storytellers THEN the confusion is part of the story ENDIF. <\/p>"

        "description": "<p>Jimmy Wales co-founded with Larry Sanger a free, online, user-generated encyclopedia, and named it Wikipedia, launching the new online encylopedia on a server located in San Diego, California. It arose from a free, online, but edited encyclopedia, Nupedia, which Wales had launched in 2000, with Sanger as editor-in-chief.<\/p><p> Within its first year the digital do-it-yourself encyclopedia had acquired 20,000 articles and 200 regular volunteer contributors. By early 2004 it had 188,000 articles (nearly four times as many as the one-volume, edited and printed Columbia Encyclopedia). By 2006 it had 895,000, or more than twice as many as the multi-volume Encyclopedia Britannica, 1989 edition, and significantly more than the next edition of 2007. Though anyone can contribute, or revise, a Wikipedia entry, regular staff check for and remove obscenity or obviously slanted content; protocols are in place to prevent contradictory revision and re-revision of controversial entries. According to David Runciman reviewing Andrew Lih's The Wikipedia Revolution, 2009, the general tendency of Wikipedia articles is to improve in accuracy rather than to deteriorate through the gradual process of revision by all comers. <\/p>"
