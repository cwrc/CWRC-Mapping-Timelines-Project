A twin brother and sister discover a sentient, radioactive, computer-stone from \"a silicon civilization\", which they name Xorandor. They then save the day by neutralizing Xorandor's \"offspring [who], because of a programming defect defined as a syntax error, turns terrorist . . . and threatens to turn into a nuclear bomb.\" In a society where literature and philosophy are obsolete, the twins find the process of narrating difficult, but they learn to speak \"a slang based on electronic and computer words (e.g., diodic for super),\" and struggle with the difficulties of storytelling (dictating into a pocket computer) which seems harder \"than to make up the most complex program.\" The girl twin ponders: \"If the storytellers are characters THEN their confusion is part of their characters ENDIF. Inversely IF the characters are the storytellers THEN the confusion is part of the story ENDIF.\" <\/p>",

        "description": "<p>The alternate-reality game or ARG Perplex City was launched by a London-based development team called Mind Candy. The lead writer on the game was Naomi Alderman, a British author and novelist who is now Professor of Creative Writing at Bath Spa University. The game marked a first for the use of ARG, as it encouraged players to buy the cards to solve the puzzles, though this was not necessary to progress through the game. In addition, this game ran for months, as opposed to the typical two-month life-span of most ARG games or promotions. Nevertheless the developers at Mind Candy announced in June 2007 that the second season of Perplex City had been put on hold indefinitely.<\/p>",
