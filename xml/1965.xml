                    <title level="j">Montreal Star</title> discussed the increasing number of homosexuals being con-
                victed in Montreal for soliciting, obscene displays, and "acting in a manner
                as to shock citizens." His research had been spurred by a comment made by
                Municipal Court Judge <persName key="#PLAC">Pascal Lachapelle</persName> that homosexuality was on the rise
                in the city. Convictions for homosexual activities had increased from 25 in
                <date when="1960">1960</date> to 166 in <date when="1964">1964</date>. Williams also interviewed members of Montreal's
                morality squad, who discussed gay night spots in town.

                At the annual general meeting of <orgName key="#ASK">ASK</orgName> a committee was
                formed to enquire into the feasibility of starting a lesbian/gay social centre

                however. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, a non-profit homophile
                organization called <orgName key="#TC">The Circle</orgName> was active in Vancouver under the direction

                homosexuality. (See also December 31,1966.)

                sexuality should be treated legally on the same basis as premarital intercourse

                made a voluntary statement to the investigators that he had engaged in sexual
                acts with males on four occasions while living in the North. A native of

                ally settled in Pine Point. The RCMP charged Klippert with four counts of
                gross indecency involving non-violent acts with consenting adult males in
                private. He appeared before Magistrate <persName key="#PPAR">P.B. Parker</persName> at

                each of the four counts, to be served concurrently. The Klippert case would

                with the matter of gay sexuality, and would prompt the introduction of
