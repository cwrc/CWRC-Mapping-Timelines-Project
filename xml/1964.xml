                        >Vancouver</placeName> In his August 5 column in the <title level="j">Globe and Mail</title>,
                        <persName key="#MHAN">Michael Hanlon</persName> stated that <placeName
                        key="#TOR">Toronto</placeName> police were worried about "the growing
                    popularity of clubs for homosexuals in the city" — there were at least four at
                    that time. The police were frustrated because "... behaviour in them is quite
                    proper and no charges can be laid." Hanlon concluded that "What worries the
                    police is not the activities in the clubs . . . but the fact that they are
                    gathering places for homosexuals and as such offer a chance for homosexuality to
                    spread by introduction." Less than two weeks later, <persName key="#OTUR">Ormond
                        Turner</persName> discussed the "problem" of clubs for homosexuals in
                        <placeName key="#VAN">Vancouver</placeName> in his "Around Town" column in
                    the <title level="j">Vancouver Province</title>. An anonymous police
                    officer was quoted as saying that the police had been "'keeping track of them'"
                    and that there had been more prosecutions involving gross indecency in the past
                    six months than in the previous two years. Turner's conclusion was almost
                    identical to Hanlon's: "What worries police is not the activities in the
                    clubs... but the fact they are gathering places and, as such, offer a chance for
                    homosexuality to spread by introduction." </p>
