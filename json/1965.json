This would be a private social club that would cooperate with ASK but be separate from it. ASK disbanded temporarily in the summer of 1965 but reformed in 1966 and continued towards the goal of forming some sort of centre. The ASK Centre, the first community social centre in Canada run by a homophile organization, opened at the end of 1966. The idea for a social group called The Circle did not disappear, however. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, a non-profit homophile organization called The Circle was active in Vancouver under the direction of Mrs. D. Beck. It was devoted to education and personal counselling on homosexuality. (See also December 31,1966.) </div>",

Klippert, who had not been involved in the fire, made a voluntary statement to the investigators that he had engaged in sexual acts with males on four occasions while living in the North. A native of Kindersley, Sask., Klippert had been convicted previously (in Calgary in 1960) of gross indecency and had been sentenced to four years in prison. Released in 1963 after serving three years, Klippert moved away and eventu- ally settled in Pine Point. The RCMP charged Klippert with four counts of gross indecency involving non-violent acts with consenting adult males in private. He appeared before Magistrate P.B. Parker at Hay River, NWT, and pleaded guilty. On August 24, 1965, Klippert was sentenced to three years on each of the four counts, to be served concurrently. The Klippert case would become one of the most important criminal cases in Canadian history to deal with the matter of gay sexuality, and would prompt the introduction of amendments to the criminal code (Bill C-150) that came into effect in August 1969.
