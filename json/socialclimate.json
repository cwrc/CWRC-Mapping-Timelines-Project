This was the first of four major outbreaks in nineteenth-century Britain.</strong></p><p>Dates: 1832-02-13</p>Another epidemic followed in June-October 1849, which resulted in some 14,000 deaths. During a subsequent outbreak in April-September 1854 in London, Dr John Snow determined that the epidemic was spread through the water system. These outbreaks began the gradual process of changing health policy, which did not, however, prevent another epidemic in 1866.In 1832 Parliament passed an Act to give local health boards the power to finance public health measures (out of the poor rate). The Public Health Act of 31 August 1848 established a General Board of Health, further enhanced the power of medical officers of health, and gave sanitary authorities the right to enforce compliance with sanitary regulations. Later, under the 1866 Sanitary Act, officers were empowered to demand that slum dwellings be either improved or torn down.Progress was slow. According to historian Geoffrey Alderman: By the end of 1853 only 182 local boards of health had been established under the 1848 Act, and only 13 of these had completed sewerage and water works.104The nineteenth century also saw epidemics of yellow fever, smallpox, diptheria, scarlet fever, dysentery, typhus and typhoid. Tuberculosis was ever-present.</div>",

Bernardette saw her about seventeen times more on various visits ending on July 16, in company with steadily increasing crowds.Lourdes quickly became one of Europe's most popular pilgrimage sites, and claimed thousands of miraculous cures. Its reputation was established by Henri Lasserre's Notre-Dame de Lourdes, 1869 and later attacked by Ã‰mile Zola in his novel Lourdes. Bernadette died in a nunnery in 1879, of tuberculosis.</div>",

In 1975 the General Synod of the Anglican Church (following the lead of that of Canada the same year) voted for ordination of women in principle, but suggested that legal barriers still needed to be attended to. On 8 November 1978, to the outrage of many women, the General Synod pronounced those legal barriers to be insurmountable.</div>",

He offered a taste of luxury to the lower and lower-middle classes, and especially the guarantee of fun even in rainy weather.

It also specialised in designing new forms (for collaborators rather than spectators) to replace traditional rituals for such events as naming children and burying the dead.
