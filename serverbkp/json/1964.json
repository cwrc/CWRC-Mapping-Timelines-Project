The police were frustrated because &quot;... behaviour in them is quite proper and no charges can be laid.&quot; Hanlon concluded that &quot;What worries the police is not the activities in the clubs . . . but the fact that they are gathering places for homosexuals and as such offer a chance for homosexuality to spread by introduction.&quot; Less than two weeks later, Ormond Turner discussed the &quot;problem&quot; of clubs for homosexuals in Vancouver in his &quot;Around Town&quot; column in the Vancouver Province. An anonymous police officer was quoted as saying that the police had been &quot;'keeping track of them'&quot; and that there had been more prosecutions involving gross indecency in the past six months than in the previous two years. Turner's conclusion was almost identical to Hanlon's: &quot;What worries police is not the activities in the clubs... but the fact they are gathering places and, as such, offer a chance for homosexuality to spread by introduction.&quot; </div>",
