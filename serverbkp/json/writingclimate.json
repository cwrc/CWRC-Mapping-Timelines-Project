Because the contest was American, she set the story in Maine.Saunders championed human rights and the rights of women throughout her life; on her seventy-third birthday, 13 May 1934, she was made a CBE, or Commander of the British Empire. With Lucy Maud Montgomery, she started the Maritime Branch of the Canadian Women's Press Club.Beautiful Joe was extremely popular in the United States, Canada, and England. It was the first book by a Canadian author to sell over a million copies, and by the 1930s had sold over 7 million copies internationally. The name Beautiful Joe was trademarked for use by the Beautiful Joe Heritage Society in promoting the humane treatment of animals, and in tangible remembrance of Saunders in the Meaford area.</div>",

Cushing went on to another American novel, Yorktown: An Historical Romance, 1826, and Cheney to a Canadian novel, The Rivals of Acadia, 1827. Both lived in Montreal as married women and involved themselves in the production there of the variously-titled journal The Literary Garland. Both, in fiction, are equally concerned with nation-building and interacting ethnicities.Saratoga opens with the heroine's father at the Plains of Abraham, at the battle where Lower Canada passed out of French rule into British. In the American revolution he is a loyalist while his daughter Catherine supports the rebels and gradually wins her father round. The pacifist point of view is represented by Quaker characters, while native characters (both good and bad) complete the picture of the birth of a composite nation.Yorktown begins at Williamsburg in 1781, with young officers talking in camp. Major Louis St Olmar loves the heroine (perhaps slightly less spirited than Catherine in Saratoga) and Edward Leslie is her brother. After another familial loyalist-patriot confrontation, Helen marries St Olmar and settles in France, while Edward remains in the USA.In A Peep at the Pilgrims in Sixteen Hundred Thirty Six a young English immigrant, Major Atherton, hears his American beloved singing even before his ship has docked at Plymouth. She converts him to Puritanism and together they extend the hand of friendship to Pequod natives (described in detail) and bring up their children in American principles of civil and religious freedom.</div>",

Its activities ranged from sending out a fake astrologer to lecture about disasters perceived in Hitler's horoscope to capturing and circulating (possibly, in the opinion of novelist William Boyd, also forging) a map showing Hitler's plans for dividing South America into five new and German-ruled states.A history of BSC was produced for selected individuals in ten typescript copies and finally published in 1998 as British Security Coordination, with an introduction by Nigel West.</div>",
