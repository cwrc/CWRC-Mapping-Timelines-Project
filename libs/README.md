## Third-Party Libraries

Plot-It uses [jQuery](http://jquery.com) and [SIMILE Exhibit](http://www.simile-widgets.org/exhibit2/). Specific documentation on these libraries can be found on their respective websites.

## jQuery

Custom JavaScript functions are written for Plot-It by leveraging jQuery. An example of these can be viewed in the `index.php` file. The version tested with the latest stable code of Plot-It as of current release is 2.0.3. Other jQuery releases can be used, but with caution as SIMILE Exhibit also relies on jQuery (see notes about versions below).

## SIMILE Exhibit

A fork of SIMILE Exhibit 2.3 is being used for Plot-It. Because the library has been customized, it is not advised to switch to other releases of SIMILE Exhibit.
