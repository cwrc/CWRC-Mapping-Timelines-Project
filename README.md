## About

Plot-It is a geo-spatial and temporal visualization tool that enables events with a temporal context (e.g. date) and a spatial context (e.g. location) to be visually displayed on an interactive map and a timeline. Plot-It is built using [SIMILE Exhibit](http://www.simile-widgets.org/exhibit2/) and [jQuery](http://jquery.com) with [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/) and it's code is written in JavaScript and PHP.

## Installation

To install Plot-It, download it to a web server's application directory that supports PHP scripts. This release has been tested on the Apache server using a MySQL database. The Geonames database will also need to be set up, please see the `geonames` folder for documentation about that. Plot-It requires data in a specific JSON schema, please see the `transformers` folder for details about the schemas. Pre-processed datasets in the required schema are included with the code files. Plot-It also supports additional map overlays, please see the `maps` folder for further details. Plot-It uses Google Maps that requires an Internet connection to work. In addition, it works best on a modern browser that supports JavaScript. Please see the `libs` folder for details about third-party libraries used to develop Plot-It.
