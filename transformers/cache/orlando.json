		"description": "Although apparently a response to radical demands for the reform of corrupt borough corporations, the act favoured the middle classes. It was, however, a landmark because it reformed systems of local government which had remained largely unchanged since medieval times. It substituted 178 new elected municipal councils for the previous corporations. Members of the town councils were to be elected by local ratepayers. The councils' duties included appointing watch committees, publishing town accounts and budgets, and taking responsibility for sanitation, water supply, and road maintenance.Clause 76 obliged all boroughs of more than 10,000 inhabitants to institute regular, paid police on the model of the London force. This clause was widely flouted; many communities were satisfied with the parochial model of policing, and were unwilling to subscribe to the newer, more costly model. Further, it was widely felt that the new system emulated France, which was perceived as a police state. While in London the fear of crime outweighed these reservations, less populous areas did not feel the threat so keenly, and citizens were unwilling to submit to the loss of liberty believed to attend the new type of policing."

During a subsequent outbreak in April-September 1854 in London, Dr John Snow determined that the epidemic was spread through the water system. These outbreaks began the gradual process of changing health policy, which did not, however, prevent another epidemic in 1866.In 1832 Parliament passed an Act to give local health boards the power to finance public health measures (out of the poor rate). The Public Health Act of 31 August 1848 established a General Board of Health, further enhanced the power of medical officers of health, and gave sanitary authorities the right to enforce compliance with sanitary regulations. Later, under the 1866 Sanitary Act, officers were empowered to demand that slum dwellings be either improved or torn down.Progress was slow. According to historian Geoffrey Alderman: By the end of 1853 only 182 local boards of health had been established under the 1848 Act, and only 13 of these had completed sewerage and water works.104The nineteenth century also saw epidemics of yellow fever, smallpox, diptheria, scarlet fever, dysentery, typhus and typhoid. Tuberculosis was ever-present."

Samuel Sharpe, a Baptist lay preacher, is cited as the leader of the rebellion, and at least one other Baptist missionary with the Anti-Slavery Society went into hiding afterwards, for fear of vengeance from fellow whites. (Plantation owners seemed to feel that the Wesleyans were less of a threat.) The background to this revolt was a new bill for regulating slave labour, and talk of actual emancipation, that had already made the owners feel themselves to be victimised.More than 200 sugar estates were burnt, and property damage was estimated to be &yen;1,132,440. Participation was estimated to extend to 60,000 slaves; 200 of these were killed, and a further 312 were executed after the outbreak had been quelled. Sharpe was hanged and buried on the seashore. Fourteen whites died.Elizabeth Barrett's father suffered a sharp drop of income in consequence of this rebellion, and had to sell his country estate in Herefordshire."

Both lived in Montreal as married women and involved themselves in the production there of the variously-titled journal The Literary Garland. Both, in fiction, are equally concerned with nation-building and interacting ethnicities.Saratoga opens with the heroine's father at the Plains of Abraham, at the battle where Lower Canada passed out of French rule into British. In the American revolution he is a loyalist while his daughter Catherine supports the rebels and gradually wins her father round. The pacifist point of view is represented by Quaker characters, while native characters (both good and bad) complete the picture of the birth of a composite nation.Yorktown begins at Williamsburg in 1781, with young officers talking in camp. Major Louis St Olmar loves the heroine (perhaps slightly less spirited than Catherine in Saratoga) and Edward Leslie is her brother. After another familial loyalist-patriot confrontation, Helen marries St Olmar and settles in France, while Edward remains in the USA.In A Peep at the Pilgrims in Sixteen Hundred Thirty Six a young English immigrant, Major Atherton, hears his American beloved singing even before his ship has docked at Plymouth. She converts him to Puritanism and together they extend the hand of friendship to Pequod natives (described in detail) and bring up their children in American principles of civil and religious freedom."

A film from it, Desert Hearts, was made in 1980. Rule, born in New Jersey in 1931, moved to British Columbia in Canada in her twenties. She became a Canadian citizen, a teacher at the University of British Columbia, a leader of the lesbian feminist community, and a highly regarded novelist, essayist, and short-story writer. On retiring from academic work she settled on Galiano Island off the BC coast, where she died of cancer on 27 November 2007."

She married Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, an early US Indian Agent, and had four children of whom two survived. Her husband carefully preserved her manuscripts, but the marriage deteriorated as he came to believe, for reasons unconnected with his wife, that native Americans were intellectually and socially inferior. Among her writings (published as The Sound the Stars Make Rushing Through the Sky in 2007) is a poem on her first child's death, My Willy, whose structure parallels that of Ann Taylor Gilbert's My Mother."

He said he wished to see them comfortably provided for in their way out. 149 Few people went willingly and the rest suffered violence. The Inverness Courier reported that in 1819 a woman in labour was carried out by her husband, wrapped in blankets, from her cottage as the roof was set alight; she gave birth in a sheep-pen two days later. But Robert Southey, who toured Scotland that year, wrote that modernization was good for people as well as for productivity as long as it was not carried on by force. 154-5 The Duchess of Sutherland had her defenders (including Harriet Beecher Stowe) 198-9 and attackers, including Donald McLeod, who wrote that the duchess would shudder at the idea of taking a faggot or a burning torch in her hand, to set fire to the cottages of her tenants . . . . Yet it was done in [her and her husband's] name, under their authority, to their knowledge, and with their sanction. 200 This controversy is still not settled among scholars. Evictions from Sutherland long continued. The Galt Reporter of Halifax, Nova Scotia, reported in July 1848 the arrival of further immigrants from the Sutherland Estates in a very distressing condition of suffering and destitution.
