README.txt

This example builds on the local example from SIMILE timeline (http://code.google.com/p/simile-widgets/downloads/list - timeline_local_example).
It adds:
1) loading from a local kml file
2) a horizontal zoombar

To get it to work ther are some additions and overrides to Timeline prototype functions. 
These are included in timeline_zoom_overrides.js.
The zoombar code is in TimelineBandZoom.js.
