It was, however, a landmark because it reformed systems of local government which had remained largely unchanged since medieval times. It substituted 178 new elected municipal councils for the previous corporations. Members of the town councils were to be elected by local ratepayers. The councils' duties included appointing watch committees, publishing town accounts and budgets, and taking responsibility for sanitation, water supply, and road maintenance.Clause 76 obliged all boroughs of more than 10,000 inhabitants to institute regular, paid police on the model of the London force. This clause was widely flouted; many communities were satisfied with the parochial model of policing, and were unwilling to subscribe to the newer, more costly model. Further, it was widely felt that the new system emulated France, which was perceived as a police state. While in London the fear of crime outweighed these reservations, less populous areas did not feel the threat so keenly, and citizens were unwilling to submit to the loss of liberty believed to attend the new type of policing.</div>"

The background to this revolt was a new bill for regulating slave labour, and talk of actual emancipation, that had already made the owners feel themselves to be victimised.More than 200 sugar estates were burnt, and property damage was estimated to be ¥1,132,440. Participation was estimated to extend to 60,000 slaves; 200 of these were killed, and a further 312 were executed after the outbreak had been quelled. Sharpe was hanged and buried on the seashore.

Holland had remained neutral during World War I, and the Dutch army had not engaged in battle since 1830. Holland surrendered on 15 May, followed by Belgium on 28 May.Wilhelmina, queen regnant of the Netherlands, was evacuated to London (reluctantly abandoning her plan to stay and co-ordinate resistance from the south of her country). There and in Canada she remained a beacon for occupied Europe throughout the war, even while the Dutch government in exile flirted with the idea of collaboration.</div>"

The legislators rejected this idea because many of them (including American Loyalist immigrants whom Simcoe wished to encourage) were slave-owners. His second proposal was to ban any dealing in or further importing of slaves, and to rule that slave children born in the colony should receive their freedom at twenty-five years old. This compromise measure passed into law in 1793, ensuring that slavery would indeed die out from Upper Canada, and making Simcoe the world's first political leader to challenge slavery effectively,A11 in the words of a recent historian.</div>"

People in authority called the process diminishing the burthen of population, 144 or getting all the mildewed land . . . cleared of people. 145 Lord Stafford (later first Duke of Sutherland) denied that he meant to promote any emigration, even while enquiring of a shipping company what they would charge to transport the emigrants (and feed them on the passage) to any convenient part of the American Continent. He said he wished to see them comfortably provided for in their way out. 149 Few people went willingly and the rest suffered violence. The Inverness Courier reported that in 1819 a woman in labour was carried out by her husband, wrapped in blankets, from her cottage as the roof was set alight; she gave birth in a sheep-pen two days later. But Robert Southey, who toured Scotland that year, wrote that modernization was good for people as well as for productivity as long as it was not carried on by force. 154-5 The Duchess of Sutherland had her defenders (including Harriet Beecher Stowe) 198-9 and attackers, including Donald McLeod, who wrote that the duchess would shudder at the idea of taking a faggot or a burning torch in her hand, to set fire to the cottages of her tenants . . . . Yet it was done in [her and her husband's] name, under their authority, to their knowledge, and with their sanction. 200 This controversy is still not settled among scholars. Evictions from Sutherland long continued. The Galt Reporter of Halifax, Nova Scotia, reported in July 1848 the arrival of further immigrants from the Sutherland Estates in a very distressing condition of suffering and destitution. The shipment included two long-term lunatics who had been sent off unaccompanied. 181 </div>"
